# Can of Books App

**Author**: Gordon P Reilley Jr, Ricardo Soto
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. We created a small app to track what books have impacted us, and what’s recommended to read next.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
1. Connect your front-end React app to a back-end Express server.
2. Connect your Express server to a MongoDB database.
3. You will need to make a “schema” in your back-end code to model how you want your data to look.
4. You will then populate your database with “seed” data—some of your favorite books.
5. When the front end makes a request to your server, your server will query the database and respond with all of the results from the database. Your front end will display these results.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
**Languages used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Libraries used**: Node.JS, React.JS, Bootstrap, MongoDB
