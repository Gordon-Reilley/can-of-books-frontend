# Can of Books App

**Author**: Gordon P Reilley Jr, Ricardo Soto
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. We created a small app to track what books have impacted us, and what’s recommended to read next.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
1. Connect your front-end React app to a back-end Express server.
2. Connect your Express server to a MongoDB database.
3. You will need to make a “schema” in your back-end code to model how you want your data to look.
4. You will then populate your database with “seed” data—some of your favorite books.
5. When the front end makes a request to your server, your server will query the database and respond with all of the results from the database. Your front end will display these results.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
**Languages used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Libraries used**: Node.JS, React.JS, Bootstrap, MongoDB

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

### Logistical

1. What hours will you be available to communicate?

    - 9 a.m. (PST) - 9 p.m. (PST)
2. What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

    - Slack
3. How often will you take breaks?
What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

    - 10 min break every hour or whenever needed if requested and talked about. If we start to fall behind 10 min every 2 hrs.

### Cooperative

1. Make a list of each person’s strengths.
How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

    - Gordon:
        - Continuous Improvement: Find better ways to do things that I have already learned how to do one way
        - Writing Ability: Improve ability to communicate ideas in writing; be able to describe projects/code in technical writing
    - Ricardo:
        - Team Player- is always willing to cooperate and put the team needs first before self.
        - Problem Solving- If there is an issue, Im always searching for ways to correct the problem either through self knowledge or google.
2. In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

    - Gordon:
        - Improvement Area: I would like to be better at utilizing MongoDB and Mongoose to display data on live webpages.
    - Ricardo:
        - Improvement Area: Need to work on making my voice be hear if I see a problem or thing a idea from the team is not good.
3. Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

    - Re-watching and following along with zoom lectures as well as clear communication when use pair programming to complete all Trello tasks.

### Conflict Resolution

1. What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

    - Bring up the problem internally and explain our concerns to each other in order to balance out the workload. If this does not resolve the problem we will involve an instructor to mediate the situation.
2. What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

    - Bring up the problem internally and explain our concerns to each other in order to make a plan of action that involves both of us contributing evenly. If this does not resolve the problem we will involve an instructor to mediate the situation.
3. How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

    - Communication is key here we both have strengths and weakness that we can leverage to balance out any gaps in skill and discrepancies.
